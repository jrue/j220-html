## J220 HTML Exercise

This is a tutorial file that corresponds to an exercise we will be doing in class. The instructor will take you through the following steps.

#### Step 1

Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). You should use the "LTS" version, which stands for long term support. 

Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) which will make it easier for us to download lessons for this class.

#### Step 2

Create a school folder for all of the projects in this class, if you haven't done so already. Put this folder on your Desktop and name it "j220_coding" exactly, all lowercase. 

Next, open your Terminal program and type in the following and press enter. This will take you into the folder on your desktop.

```
cd ~/Desktop/j220_coding
```

Next, type the following and press enter. This will download the lesson files from Github into your school folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/jrue/j220-html.git
```

Next, type the following and press enter. This will take you into the folder you just downloaded.

```
cd j220-html
```

Next, type the following and press enter. This will install the necessary software to run this exercise.

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Next, type the following, and press enter. This will install the rest of the dependencies you'll need to run this exercise.

```
npm install
```

#### Step 3

When you want to run your software and see your webpage, run the following command:

```
npm grunt
```

Keep your Terminal window open and visit the URL shown in your browser. You can make changes to your index.html file using Sublime Text and save as needed.
